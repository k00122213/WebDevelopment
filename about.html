<h1>ABOUT simple little stitches!</h1>
<h2>Hi!</h2>
 
<p>
Hi! My name is Clodagh and my journey into the world of Cross Stitching began in May 2016. I had always enjoyed art, traditional and digital, but at times
I found it hard to a lift a pencil(or stylus) to creat a piece of art or even just to doodle.
</p>
<p>I suffered a great deal of anxiety and panic attacks, because at this time I was just out of my bachelors degree and desperately seeking work. I was 
very lost and did not know what to do with my time besides applying for jobs and waiting to hear back. The cross stitching was suggested to me by 
some family and friends, as a way to keep my mind occupied and at ease. As I am someone who is goal-orientated, I found that, as soon as I began, I was able to maintain focus and keep my anxiety and stress to a minimum.
</p>
<p>
Like any craft, cross stitching has phases. It has a beginning (prep work), a middle (the physical stitching) and an end (preparing to display). Having a goal in sight
with smaller tasks that are not impssible but still challenging can be a very rewarding exercise. It helped bring structure to my unemployed life. Since then, I have returned to education and have cross stitched less but still keep up my hobby to help me
through difficult times.
</p>
<p>
I created this website as part of a college assignment for my Web Development module and hope to update it as I continue to learn more!
</p>
<p>
I would like to include some <a href="links.html">links</a> about the relationship between a needle work hobby such as cross stitch and improved mental health. This hobby has worked wonders
for the mental health of myself as well as friends and family and I feel it can do the same for others who are looking for some creative grounding and focus in their lives.
